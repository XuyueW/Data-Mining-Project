# Data Mining Project: Banking Loan Prediction

A bank’s digital division is encountering obstacles in converting leads into customers.  Their main goal is to enhance customer acquisition through digital means.  The main focus is to increase the number of leads that enter the conversion.  They obtain leads through search engines, display ads, email campaigns, and through affiliate partners.  Naturally, the conversion rate varies depending on the source and quality of the leads.

The current objective is to identify the segments of leads that have higher conversion rate (from lead to purchasing a product).  This will enable them to specifically target these potential customers through additional channels and re-marketing strategies.  The data set contains a customers’ loan history from the past three months, as well as their basic information.

Our data set is from the Kaggle, which contains 30,038 rows and 22 columns.
